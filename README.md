# You can control Windows using the gamepad!


With this program, you can control Windows using a gamepad.


I think it's quite convenient, for example, to manage a computer, media center, etc.


Controls:


   Left trigger = Right click

   
   Right trigger = Left click

   
   Button A = move mode on

   
   Double button A = accept move mode

   
   Button B = Cancel move mode

   
   Left stick = control cursor


   Right stick = Scroling left and right
